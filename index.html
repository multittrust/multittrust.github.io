              <p>MULTITTRUST is a workshop of <a href="https://www.hhai-conference.org/">HHAI conference 2023</a>. This workshop appears from the need to create a multidisciplinary research community of people who study the different perspectives and layers of trust dynamics in human-AI teams.
                Human-AI teamwork is no longer a topic of the future. With the increasing prominence of these teams in diverse industries, several challenges arise that need to be addressed carefully.
                One of these challenges is understanding how trust is defined and how it functions in Human-AI teams. Psychological literatures suggests that within human teams, team members rely on trust to make decisions and to be willing to rely on their team.
                Besides that, the multi-agent systems (MAS) community has been adopting trust mechanisms to support decision-making of the agents regarding their peers. Finally, in the last couple of years, researchers have been focusing on how humans trust AI and how AI can be trustworthy. But when we think of a team composed of both humans and AI, with recurrent (or not) interactions, how do these all come together? Currently, we are missing approaches that integrate prior literature on trust in teams in these different disciplines (esp. Psychology and Computer Science).
                In particular, when looking at dyadic or team-level trust relationships in such a team, we also need to look at how an AI should trust a human teammate and how trust can be defined in such teams.              Furthermore, the trust of the human in the AI team member and vice-versa will change over time and also affect each other. In this workshop, we want to motivate the conversation across the different fields and domains.
                Together, we may shape the road to answer these questions and more.</p>

              <h3>The Problematic Problems of Human Trust in Robots:<br>Is Trusting a Robot More like a Teammate or a Tool and should we really care?</h3>
              <p>As robotics advances and permeates various aspects of our social and work lives, the question of how humans we view and ultimately trust robots has become increasingly pertinent. Do humans view them as mere machines, automated tools designed to serve their needs or do they embrace a more empathetic approach, viewing and trusting them as actual teammates (i.e. humans)? On the one hand, proponents of robots as possible humans argue that computers are social actors (CASA) and that humans mindlessly interact with computers in much the same way they do humans. This view is often used to justify the employment of human-to-human theories and their corresponding measures to understand human-robot interactions. On the other hand, advocates of mechanization contend that humans do not view robots as humans but instead as automated tools. This view discourages using human-to-human theories and their corresponding measures to understand human-robot interactions. They advocate for more human-to-automation theories and measures of constructs like trust. In this thought-provoking presentation, I will explore the arguments supporting both perspectives and consider the potential consequences of each approach. Ultimately, this presentation aims to provide a balanced understanding of the complexities involved to encourage a nuanced dialogue on the subject. </p>

              <h3>Let's talk about trust</h3>
              <p>Trust is a hot topic. It’s something very important to humans, it’s important to teams, and it’s important for AI. So many people are looking into trust, and as human-AI team researchers it seems something we should care a lot about. But what do we actually mean when we talk about trust? There’s a lot of different perspectives and definitions. Should we care about that, or try to come to an agreement? In this talk, I argue that meaning is more important than agreement when it comes to words. But meaning is crucial, as through looking at the different meanings of trust, we also might gain new perspectives on how to achieve it.</p>
